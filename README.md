# Tea mod

It's a lil silly Minecraft mod that I've been spending evenings the last few months on (as of writing this). It's my first proper mod and it's unfinished yet, don't have that much time to develop because of college and life being busy in general but I'm getting there. 

Currently the mod adds a few teas, some with interesting effects.

I'm planning for this to be a part/dependency of a bigger mod that I'll be working on, it will include tea dimensions, tea magic, tea energy and a lot of stuff. As of currently it's just a concept though.
